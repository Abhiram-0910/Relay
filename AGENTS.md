# AGENTS.md — Session Handoff Log

This file is updated at the END of every Claude Code session.
Claude reads this at the START of every new session to understand what happened before.

## Project State
**Last updated:** 2026-07-24
**Current branch:** master
**Overall status:** Backend pipeline through deterministic generation is working and live-verified end to end (parse → validate → generate). Sandbox execution (Task 8) not started. No frontend yet.

## Session Log

### Session 1 — 2026-07-24
**Goal:** Stand up the project from an empty template and build the MVP pipeline as far as deterministic client generation, before touching the Docker sandbox.

**Completed:**
- [x] Filled in `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TODO.md` from unfilled templates with the real project brief (OpenAPI → validated typed client generator); `git init` + `.gitignore`.
- [x] `backend/app/main.py` — `POST /api/parse-spec`: Pydantic-validated URL in, SSE stream out. Fetches the spec, parses with prance, validates with openapi-spec-validator.
- [x] `backend/app/generate.py` — deterministic generation, no LLM: for every operation with a JSON response, generates a standalone Pydantic response model (+ request model if the operation has a JSON request body) via datamodel-code-generator, and a client method via Jinja2. Handles path params, query params (with None-filtering so unset optional filters aren't sent as literal `"None"`), and JSON request bodies. Operations without a JSON response are reported as skipped with a reason, not silently dropped.
- [x] SSE stream extended with a `generating` stage reporting per-endpoint progress (`current`/`total`/`endpoint`); result event carries both `generated` and `skipped` lists.
- [x] Test suite: 8 default tests (parse/validate paths, generation for path-param/query-param/request-body/skip cases) + 1 `@pytest.mark.live` test (excluded by default via `pytest.ini`, run with `-m live`) that hits the real Swagger Petstore spec end-to-end and compile-checks every generated file.
- [x] Live-verified against real Swagger Petstore spec: 19/19 operations accounted for, 14 generated, 5 correctly skipped (no JSON response), every generated `models.py`/`client.py` pair passed `compile()`.
- [x] Docker installed natively in WSL and confirmed working (`docker run hello-world`).
- [x] Three commits: docs+skeleton, single-endpoint generation slice, full-spec generation scale-up.

**Decisions made:**
- Native Docker in WSL, not Docker Desktop's WSL integration. Reason: the deploy target (Oracle Cloud VM) runs native Docker with no Docker Desktop involved — matching dev to prod now avoids a "works on my machine, fails on the VM" surprise when Task 8 lands.
- Each endpoint generates its own independent models.py/client.py pair rather than being merged into one client package. Reason: avoids inventing schema-dedup/merge logic before there's a real deliverable file tree to justify it (YAGNI); flagged as debt to revisit once sandbox execution needs an actual assembled package.
- Response/request model names are always `{OperationId}Response` / `{OperationId}Request`, not the original OpenAPI component name (e.g. not `Pet`). Reason: component names are lost once prance's `ResolvingParser` fully dereferences `$ref`s, and operation-based naming is guaranteed collision-free across endpoints without extra bookkeeping.

**Problems encountered:**
- `python3 -m venv` failed (`ensurepip` unavailable, needs `apt install python3.14-venv`); `sudo` had no TTY through the Claude Code session so the apt install couldn't run from here. Worked around with `pip install --user --break-system-packages virtualenv`. Debt: install `python3.14-venv` properly on the Oracle VM at deploy time.
- Docker was completely absent from the WSL distro at first check (not just misconfigured) — user installed it natively in parallel while generation work continued; confirmed working before end of session.
- Real bug: concatenating two independently-generated Python modules (response models + request models) placed a second `from __future__ import annotations` mid-file, which is a `SyntaxError` (future imports must be the first statement). Fixed with an import-hoisting merge (`_merge_python_modules` in `generate.py`) that dedupes all top-level imports to the top of the file. Caught by the test suite, not by inspection — reinforces running the generated-code compile check on every endpoint, not just the first.

**Left incomplete:**
- [ ] Docker sandbox runner (Task 8) — not started.
- [ ] Claude Haiku self-correction loop on sandbox failure, escalate to Sonnet — not started, depends on Task 8.
- [ ] SQLite (WAL) per-IP rate limiting — not started.
- [ ] Frontend (Next.js) — not started.
- [ ] TypeScript client generation (openapi-typescript) — not started.
- [ ] Prism mock fallback for unsafe-to-call-live endpoints — not started.
- [ ] Merging per-endpoint client files into one cohesive client package — deferred (see decisions above).

**Next session should start with:**
- Task 8: build the Docker sandbox runner. One `--rm` container per run, network-restricted, resource/time capped, that executes a generated client against the live target API (Open-Meteo as the default demo target) and reports pass/fail. Docker is confirmed available — verify with `docker run hello-world` first thing if picking this up in a new environment.
